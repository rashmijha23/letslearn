        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbour and support life. Its hydrosphere is the only one in the Solar system sustaining large bodies of liquid surface water. Furthermore Earth's surface is predominantly water, either as water ice at the polar regions, but mostly as liquid water making 70.8% of Earth's surface, mainly consisting of the Ocean, with its oceans, seas, gulfs, etc., but also other salt-water and freshwater bodies like lakes and rivers. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands, most of it lying in the land hemisphere. The surface alltogether rests on several rigid tectonic plates[list] of Earth's crust, which migrate over many millions of years and are driven by a convective mantle around a solid iron inner core and a liquid outer core, which generates Earth's magnetic field, deflecting destructive solar winds and generating polar lights.</p>
